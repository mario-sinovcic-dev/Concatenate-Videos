# Infrastructure and Testing Improvements

## Overview
This PR introduces infrastructure as code and improves the testing framework for the video concatenation service. The changes focus on reliability, maintainability, and local development experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Added modular Terraform configuration for AWS resources:
  - S3 bucket for video storage
  - SQS queue for job processing
  - RDS PostgreSQL for job metadata
- Implemented environment-specific configurations (dev/prod)
- Added state management configuration
- Included comprehensive documentation

### 2. Testing Framework
- Implemented Jest-based testing setup
- Added Docker Compose configuration for local testing
- Created test utilities for Docker management
- Added health check mechanisms
- Optimized test execution times

### 3. CI/CD Improvements
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- Implemented Docker layer caching
- Optimized build and test processes
- Added artifact management

## Testing Instructions
1. Local Development:
   ```bash
   # Start local infrastructure
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

   # Run tests
   cd tests
   npm test
   ```

2. Infrastructure Testing:
   ```bash
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   ```

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes to existing infrastructure
- Local development workflow remains compatible
- Added new environment variables for AWS services

## Security Considerations
- Database credentials managed via environment variables
- S3 bucket configured with appropriate access controls
- SQS queue configured with standard security practices

## Next Steps
1. Implement database migrations
2. Add monitoring and alerting
3. Configure production environment
4. Add more comprehensive test coverage
